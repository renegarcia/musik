1. MediaTableModel is not safe if you remove or insert rows. We should either

Reimplement coreplaylist (emit signals to connect to something like beginremoverows, endremoverows
in the model

Change the core/model architechture to let the core be less independent from the model and the model
more aware of the core and the xmms api.


2. Merge qxmms2 into main code DONE

3. implement QXmmss2::seek ( int ms ) DONE

4. Connect dataChanged signal from the core to the models
